# Energy Rental

All transactions on JustLend DAO require Energy, which can only be acquired through staking or burning TRX. This process involves high costs and lengthy procedures. In response, JustLend DAO introduces the Energy Rental service, allowing users to rent Energy at a significantly reduced price compared to staking or burning TRX.
The contract [EnergyRental](https://tronscan.io/#/contract/TU2MJ5Veik1LRAgjeSzEdvmDYx7mefJZvd) used to set up the Energy Rental service.


### **PrePay & Refund**

During the energy rental process, a prepayment amount, which includes a deposit and rent, is calculated based
on the **Rental Amount** and **Rental Duration**. The detailed formula is as follows:

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
    Prepay = trxAmount ∗ rentalRate ∗ (durationValueInSeconds + 86400 + liquidateThreshold) + fee
</div>

Upon normal termination of the rental, a portion of the deposit will be refunded based on the energy usage. The specific refund calculation formula is as follows:

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
    Refund at least = trxAmount ∗ rentalRate ∗ (21600 + liquidateThreshold) + fee
</div>

#### **Parameters:**

* To determine the value of `trxAmount`, use the following formula:
    * `energyAmount:` is the amount of energy you are renting **(Rental Amount)**.
    * `energyStakePerTrx:` is the energy staked per in Trx, which can be retrieved by calling the [/strx/dashboard](https://labc.ablesdxd.link/strx/dashboard) API.

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
    trxAmount = energyAmount / energyStakePerTrx
</div>

* `durationValueInSeconds:` the duration of the energy rental in seconds, calculated by converting the **Rental Duration** into seconds.
* `rentalRate:` the borrowing interest rate, which is the rate paid per second by the borrower to the staker, scaled by 10^18.
* `liquidateThreshold:` the liquidation threshold, which is the remaining rental duration of the user's prepayment, initialized to 0.
* `fee:` the penalty reserve for liquidation. Users who execute liquidation can receive a liquidation reward calculated as `Max(40 TRX, 0.05% * energyAmount / energyRentPerTrx)`, which can be retrieved by calling the [/strx/dashboard](https://labc.ablesdxd.link/strx/dashboard) API. The minimum fee is 40 TRX.

**Note:** the parameters of `rentalRate` and `liquidateThreshold` can be obtained by calling the [EnergyRental](https://tronscan.io/#/contract/TU2MJ5Veik1LRAgjeSzEdvmDYx7mefJZvd) contract.
