# JustLend V2 (Moolah)

**JustLend V2**, codenamed **Moolah**, is an isolated-market lending protocol on TRON, paired with **ERC4626 vaults** for passive supply-side yield. It runs alongside — not instead of — [JustLend V1](contracts_overview.md): V1 remains the Compound-V2-style pooled `jToken` market, while V2 adds an isolated-market model.

!!! note "V1 vs V2 at a glance"
    | | **V1 (jToken market)** | **V2 (Moolah)** |
    |---|---|---|
    | Model | Compound V2 — one shared pool per asset | Isolated markets (à la Morpho Blue) |
    | Risk | Cross-collateral within the Comptroller | Contained per market (one collateral, one loan asset) |
    | Supply side | Mint `jTokens` | Deposit into an **ERC4626 vault** (or supply directly into a market) |
    | Identifier | `jToken` address | `marketId` (bytes32) |
    | Liquidation | Comptroller close-factor / incentive | Public liquidator at the market's **LLTV** |

## Protocol model

### Markets (isolated)

A Moolah market is fully described by an immutable **`MarketParams`** tuple and addressed by its **`marketId`** (a bytes32 hash of those params):

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `loanToken` | the asset that is borrowed / supplied for yield |
| `collateralToken` | the asset posted as collateral |
| `oracle` | price feed used to value collateral vs loan |
| `irm` | interest-rate model |
| `lltv` | **liquidation loan-to-value**, scaled by `1e18` (e.g. `750000000000000000` = 75%) |

Because every market is a self-contained `(loan, collateral, oracle, irm, lltv)` tuple, risk is **isolated**: a bad asset in one market cannot drain another. Interest accrues into a **shares** accounting model — `supplyShares` and `borrowShares` whose value grows as interest is paid, rather than per-block index rebasing.

A position's **risk** is reported as a `0–1+` ratio against `lltv` (the MCP server surfaces this as `risk` / `riskLevel`): `> 1.0` means the position is liquidatable.

### Vaults (ERC4626)

Moolah **vaults** are ERC4626 tokenized vaults that aggregate supply-side liquidity and allocate it across markets. Users `deposit` an underlying asset and receive vault **shares**; `withdraw` (by asset amount) or `redeem` (by share amount) to exit. Vaults also accrue **mining** rewards (USDD / TRX splits).

### Liquidation

When a borrower's risk reaches the market `lltv`, anyone may liquidate through the **PublicLiquidatorProxy**: repay part of the debt (in the loan token) and seize the corresponding collateral at a discount. See `get_moolah_pending_liquidations` / `get_moolah_liquidation_quote` / `moolah_liquidate` in the [MCP server tool catalog](../ai_support/mcp_server.md#tools-96-total).

### Native TRX

Native TRX is not an ERC20, so TRX operations route through the **TrxProviderProxy**, which wraps/unwraps **WTRX** transparently. Callers pass TRX amounts as `callValue`; TRC20 markets/vaults use the **MoolahProxy** directly after an `approve`.

## Deployed contracts

Addresses are the source-of-truth deployment config tracked in the MCP server's [`src/core/chains.ts`](https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend/blob/main/src/core/chains.ts). Always verify against on-chain data before integrating.

!!! warning "Nile vaults not deployed"
    The Moolah **core** contracts are live on Nile, but the **vaults are not yet deployed** there. Vault-level calls on Nile will fail at the chain layer. The V2 REST backend (dashboards/history) is **mainnet-only**.

## Using Moolah via the MCP server

The [JustLend MCP Server](../ai_support/mcp_server.md) (v1.1.0+) exposes the full V2 surface under `moolah_*` / `get_moolah_*` tools — vaults, markets, liquidation, dashboard/history, and mining — plus four guided prompts (`moolah_supply`, `moolah_borrow`, `moolah_liquidate`, `moolah_portfolio`). See the [V2 tool groups](../ai_support/mcp_server.md#tools-96-total) and the [MCP Tool Catalog](../documents/aidocs/mcp_tools.md).

Contract ABIs (`MOOLAH_CORE_ABI`, `TRX_PROVIDER_ABI`, `MOOLAH_VAULT_ABI`, `PUBLIC_LIQUIDATOR_ABI`) are bundled in the MCP repo's [`src/core/abis.ts`](https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend/blob/main/src/core/abis.ts).
