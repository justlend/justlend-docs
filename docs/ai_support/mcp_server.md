!!! tip "AI-agent companion pages"
    For retrieval-optimized answers, start from [AI Docs Index](../documents/aidocs/index.md), [MCP Safety Policy](../documents/aidocs/mcp_safety.md), [Common Questions](../documents/aidocs/common_questions.md), and the [MCP Tool Catalog](../documents/aidocs/mcp_tools.md).

!!! tip "Before integrating"
    Read [Common Pitfalls](../developers/common_pitfalls.md) for the 10 most frequent JustLend-integration foot-guns (USDT `approve()` race condition, `enterMarkets()` requirement, `mint()` overload between jTRX and jTRC20, jToken vs underlying decimals, `liquidateBorrow` 50% close-factor cap, `uint256(-1)` repay sentinel, …). For precise term definitions used throughout the MCP tool descriptions (mantissa, kink, utilization, collateral / close / reserve factor, exchange rate, market `status`), see the [Glossary](../resources/glossary.md). The MCP server enforces several of these patterns internally (e.g. it runs TRC20 allowance checks before supply/repay), but understanding them helps you debug failed transactions and write callers that don't fight the server.

The JustLend MCP Server (`@justlend/mcp-server-justlend`) is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that enables AI agents to interact with the **JustLend DAO** protocol on TRON. Supply assets, borrow against collateral, manage positions, rent energy, stake TRX for sTRX, and analyze DeFi portfolios — all through a unified AI interface.

Beyond JustLend-specific operations, the server also exposes a full set of **general-purpose TRON chain utilities** — balance queries, block/transaction data, token metadata, TRX transfers, smart contract reads/writes, staking (Stake 2.0), multicall, and more.

!!! note
    Current version (**v1.1.2**) covers **JustLend V1** *and* **JustLend V2**. V1 is the Compound-V2-style pooled supply/borrow market (jTokens); V2 is an isolated-market + ERC4626-vault protocol. The two surfaces are namespaced — V1 tools like `get_market_data` / `supply`, V2 tools prefixed `moolah_*` / `get_moolah_*` (the `moolah` identifier is V2's on-chain/tool naming). See the [JustLend V2](../developers/justlend_v2.md) developer page for the protocol model and deployed contracts.

!!! tip "v1.1.2 Update"
    **v1.1.2** adds native **TRX ↔ WTRX** wrap/unwrap (`wrap_trx` / `unwrap_trx`) and hardens TRC20 approvals — USDT/USDC/USDJ reset the allowance to `0` before a new non-zero `approve`, and `amount='0'` reliably revokes. The surface is now **98 tools**. **v1.1.0** introduced **JustLend V2** support (from 59): 30 V2 tools (vaults, markets, liquidation, dashboard/history, mining) + 7 historical-records tools, plus 4 V2 AI prompts (**14** total) and a V2 gas estimator. It also ships **AI-agent ergonomics** — structured self-healing tool errors (`{ error, errorCode, hint }`), self-describing amounts (`{ raw, decimals, _unit, display }`) on core reads, and hardened input schemas (Base58-address + decimal-amount validation). The machine-readable `mcp-api-list.md` catalog is regenerated from source (now 98 tools). All prior V1 safety work remains in place: TRC20 allowance checks before supply/repay, opt-in `max` approvals with revoke hints, typed broadcast handling, `toSafeCallValueNumber` guards on every broadcast/simulation path, mainnet fail-closed on pre-flight `REVERT`, constant-time `MCP_API_KEY` comparison, and governance failed-proposal filtering.

## Overview

[JustLend DAO](https://justlend.org) is the largest lending protocol on TRON, based on the Compound V2 architecture. This MCP server wraps the full protocol functionality into tools and guided prompts that local MCP clients such as Claude Desktop, Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor can use.

### Key Capabilities

**JustLend Protocol**

- **Market Data**: Real-time APYs, TVL, utilization rates, prices for all markets
    - Smart fallback: contract queries first, API fallback for reliability
    - TTL caching (30–60s) to reduce RPC calls
- **Account Data**: Full position analysis via Multicall3 batch queries on TRON Mainnet (`TX56WKxtja91Dybf2FdN4hZbDLyKVxxhAu`, ~2.5s vs ~8s legacy)
    - Health factor, collateral, borrow positions
    - On-chain Oracle prices with API fallback
- **Batch Wallet Balances**: Query all TRC20 token balances in a single Multicall3 RPC call
- **Mining Rewards**: Advanced mining reward calculation
    - Detailed breakdown by market and reward token (USDD, TRX, WBTC, etc.)
    - Separates new period vs. last period rewards
    - USD value calculation with live token prices
    - Mining status tracking (ongoing/paused/ended) and period end times
    - Nile fallback returns an empty reward set instead of failing when the testnet rewards API is unavailable
- **Supply / Borrow / Repay / Withdraw**: Full lending operations with pre-flight checks
- **Collateral Management**: Enter/exit markets, manage what counts as collateral
- **Portfolio Analysis**: AI-guided risk assessment, health factor monitoring, optimization
- **Token Approvals**: Manage TRC20 approvals for jToken contracts
- **Energy Cost Estimation**: Estimate energy, bandwidth, and TRX cost for any lending operation before executing
- **JST Voting / Governance**: View proposals, cast votes, deposit/withdraw JST for voting power, reclaim votes
- **Energy Rental**: Rent energy from JustLend, calculate rental prices, query rental orders, return/cancel rentals
- **sTRX Staking**: Stake TRX to receive sTRX, unstake sTRX, claim staking rewards, check withdrawal eligibility
    - Precision-safe BigInt/string math for TRX Sun conversion and 18-decimal sTRX balances/exchange-rate display

**Browser Wallet Signing**

- **TronLink Integration**: Connect TronLink or other browser wallets via `tronlink-signer` SDK
- **Sign-only mode**: Server builds transactions, browser only signs — private keys never leave the wallet
- **Dual wallet mode**: Users choose between `browser` (recommended) or `agent` (encrypted local storage)

**General TRON Chain**

- **Balances**: TRX balance (with Sun/TRX conversion), TRC20/TRC1155 token balances
- **Blocks**: Latest block, block by number/hash, block number, chain ID
- **Transactions**: Fetch transaction details, receipts, wait for confirmation
- **Contracts**: Read/write any contract, fetch on-chain ABI, multicall (v2 & v3), deploy, estimate energy
- **Token Metadata**: TRC20 info (name/symbol/decimals/supply), TRC721 metadata, TRC1155 URI
- **Transfers**: Send TRX, transfer TRC20 tokens, approve spenders
- **Staking (Stake 2.0)**: Freeze/unfreeze TRX for BANDWIDTH or ENERGY, withdraw expired unfreeze
- **Address Utilities**: Hex ↔ Base58 conversion, address validation, resolution
- **Wallet**: Sign messages, secure key management via agent-wallet or browser wallet

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20.0.0 or higher
- Optional: [TronGrid API key](https://www.trongrid.io/) for reliable mainnet access (strongly recommended)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend.git
cd mcp-server-justlend
npm install
```

## Quick Setup

For a guided setup experience (build, configure, generate `.mcp.json`):

```bash
bash scripts/setup-mcp-test.sh
# Add --claude-desktop to also print Claude Desktop JSON
```

The script checks Node.js 20+, installs dependencies, builds the project, and generates local Claude Code config.

## Configuration

### Wallet Setup (First-Use Choice)

On first use, the server presents a wallet mode selection. Users choose between:

1. **Browser mode** (recommended): Connect TronLink via `connect_browser_wallet` — private keys never leave the browser
2. **Agent mode**: Encrypted local wallet via `set_wallet_mode` with `mode="agent"` — keys stored in `~/.agent-wallet/`

Private keys are **never** stored in environment variables by default.

You can also manage wallets via **CLI** or **MCP tools**:

#### CLI (agent-wallet)
```bash
# Import an existing private key or mnemonic
npx agent-wallet add

# Generate a new wallet
npx agent-wallet generate

# List all wallets
npx agent-wallet list

# Switch active wallet
npx agent-wallet activate <wallet-id>
```

#### MCP Tools (runtime)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_wallet_address` | Shows current address, or returns first-use wallet selection guidance |
| `connect_browser_wallet` | Connect TronLink / browser wallet for signing |
| `set_wallet_mode` | Switch between `browser` and `agent` signing |
| `get_wallet_mode` | Show current signing mode and addresses |
| `list_wallets` | List all wallets with IDs, types, addresses |
| `set_active_wallet` | Switch active wallet by ID |

Importing an existing private key is intentionally not exposed as an MCP tool because MCP arguments can be logged by clients and transports. Use the CLI instead:

```bash
npx agent-wallet import
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Strongly recommended — avoids TronGrid 429 rate limiting on mainnet
export TRONGRID_API_KEY="your_trongrid_api_key"

# Optional: HTTP/SSE transport mode — start it with `npm run start:http`
# (entrypoint is src/server/http-server.ts; there is no transport env toggle)
export PORT="3001"                 # HTTP server port (default: 3001)
export MCP_HOST="127.0.0.1"        # HTTP server host / bind address (default: 127.0.0.1)
export MCP_CORS_ORIGIN=""          # required allow-list if you bind to a non-loopback host

# Required in HTTP mode — see "HTTP Mode Authentication" below for how to generate one
export MCP_API_KEY="your_strong_random_secret"
```

### HTTP Mode Authentication (`MCP_API_KEY`)

**Most users do not need this.** Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Cursor connect over **stdio** by default, which has no network surface and no auth. `MCP_API_KEY` only applies when you run the server in **HTTP/SSE mode** (`npm run start:http`).

#### What it is

`MCP_API_KEY` is a self-chosen Bearer-token shared secret between the server and its clients. It is **not** issued by Anthropic, JustLend, or any third party — you generate it yourself, set it on the server, and share it with clients you trust.

The HTTP server reads the variable at startup and **refuses to start without it**. Every incoming request to `/sse` and `/messages` must carry an `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_API_KEY>` header — anything else returns `401 Unauthorized`. The `/health` endpoint is the only exception.

##### Version history

The variable name has been around for a while; what changed is how the server treats it. To avoid confusion when reading older deployment guides:

| Version | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| v1.0.1 – v1.0.3 | `MCP_API_KEY` exists but is **optional**. If unset, the HTTP server starts with no auth (every request is accepted). |
| **v1.0.4** | `MCP_API_KEY` becomes **required**. The server refuses to start without it, returning `MCP_API_KEY is required in HTTP mode. Refusing to start without authentication.` Comparison still uses plain string equality. |
| **v1.0.5** | Comparison upgraded to `crypto.timingSafeEqual` with an explicit length check, closing a timing side-channel. The variable itself is unchanged — same name, same role, same "required" semantics as v1.0.4. |

##### Why the timing-safe upgrade matters

Plain string equality (`provided === expected`) returns at the first byte mismatch. An attacker who can measure response latency — for example, by sending many requests from the same network — can distinguish "first byte matched, second byte mismatched" (slightly slower) from "first byte mismatched" (slightly faster) and recover the secret one byte at a time. Network jitter and CPU noise blunt the signal but do not eliminate it; the [classic demonstration](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf) recovers cross-network secrets in hours.

`crypto.timingSafeEqual` compares every byte regardless of where the first mismatch occurs, so the runtime depends only on the input length, not the input content. Length is checked separately because `timingSafeEqual` throws on unequal lengths, and the length of `Bearer <key>` is not itself the secret.

#### When you need it

You need to set `MCP_API_KEY` if any of the following apply:

- You are deploying the MCP server to a remote machine and connecting over SSE.
- You are exposing the server behind a reverse proxy (NGINX, Caddy) on a LAN, container network, or the public internet.
- You are writing or running an MCP client that talks to this server over HTTP rather than over stdio.

If you are simply running Claude Desktop / Claude Code / Cursor against a local stdio server (the default), you can ignore this variable entirely.

#### How to generate one

Generate a strong random string locally — any of the following work:

```bash
# 32 random bytes, base64-encoded (recommended)
openssl rand -base64 32

# Or hex
openssl rand -hex 32

# Or a UUID
uuidgen
```

Set it on the server before starting:

```bash
export MCP_API_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
npm run start:http
```

#### How clients send it

Clients pass the same value as a Bearer token on every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-MCP_API_KEY>
```

For example, a `curl` health-check vs. an authenticated SSE connection:

```bash
# /health does not require the header
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/health

# /sse requires the Authorization header — without it the server returns 401
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCP_API_KEY" http://127.0.0.1:3001/sse
```

#### Security guidelines

- Treat `MCP_API_KEY` like a database password: never commit it to git, never paste it into issue trackers or chat logs, and rotate it if it leaks.
- Use **at least 32 bytes** of entropy. Short or guessable values defeat the purpose.
- Always pair HTTP mode with **TLS** (HTTPS) when the server is reachable from anywhere other than `localhost`. A Bearer token sent over plain HTTP is sent in cleartext on every request.
- Bind to `127.0.0.1` (the default) unless you explicitly need remote access. If you need remote access, terminate TLS at a reverse proxy and only forward to the local port.
- The same key is shared by every client that connects. If you need per-client identities, put a proxy in front of the server that maps client identities to a single back-end key.

### Client Configuration

Build the local server first:

```bash
npm run build
```

All local client examples below use the built stdio entrypoint:

```bash
node /absolute/path/to/mcp-server-justlend/build/index.js
```

#### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "justlend": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-server-justlend/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TRONGRID_API_KEY": "SET_VIA_SYSTEM_ENV"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Code

Add to `.mcp.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "justlend": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-server-justlend/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TRONGRID_API_KEY": "SET_VIA_SYSTEM_ENV"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

!!! tip
    No `TRON_PRIVATE_KEY` needed — choose browser-wallet signing or encrypted agent-wallet mode at runtime.

#### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "justlend": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-server-justlend/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TRONGRID_API_KEY": "SET_VIA_SYSTEM_ENV"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

```bash
# Stdio mode (for MCP clients)
npm start

# HTTP/SSE mode (for remote clients)
npm run start:http

# Development with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

### Prompts (AI-Guided Workflows)

The server exposes **14 MCP prompts**. Required arguments are marked **bold**; the rest are optional. Every prompt accepts an optional `network` (`mainnet` default, or `nile`).

| Prompt | Arguments | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `getting_started` | _(none)_ | First-time onboarding: wallet setup, connection, feature tour |
| `supply_assets` | **`market`**, **`amount`**, `network` | Step-by-step supply with balance checks and approval |
| `borrow_assets` | **`market`**, **`amount`**, `network` | Safe borrowing with risk assessment and health factor checks |
| `repay_borrow` | **`market`**, **`amount`** (or `'max'`), `network` | Guided repayment with verification |
| `analyze_portfolio` | `address`, `network` | Comprehensive portfolio analysis with risk scoring |
| `compare_markets` | **`action`** (`supply` \| `borrow`), `network` | Find best supply/borrow opportunities |
| `rent_energy` | **`receiverAddress`**, **`energyAmount`**, **`durationDays`**, `network` | Guided energy rental with price estimation and balance checks |
| `stake_trx` | **`amount`**, `network` | Guided TRX staking to sTRX with APY info and verification |
| `query_proposals` | `network` | Browse and query governance proposals, check voting requirements |
| `cast_vote` | **`proposalId`**, **`support`** (`for` \| `against`), **`amount`** (WJST), `network` | Guided governance voting with vote verification |
| `moolah_supply` | `vaultSymbol`, `amount`, `network` | Deposit into a V2 ERC4626 vault (compares vaults if `vaultSymbol` omitted) |
| `moolah_borrow` | `marketId`, `collateralAmount`, `borrowAmount`, `network` | Supply collateral and/or borrow in a V2 market (browses markets if `marketId` omitted) |
| `moolah_liquidate` | `network` | Find and execute a V2 liquidation opportunity |
| `moolah_portfolio` | `address`, `network` | Analyze a user's full V2 position across vaults and markets |

> All prompt arguments are strings (the `enum` ones accept only the listed values). Prompts return a templated message that drives the agent through the workflow using the read/write tools above — they do **not** sign transactions themselves.

### Resources

The server registers one MCP **resource** for static protocol context an agent can read once and cache:

| URI | MIME type | Contents |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| `justlend://protocol-info` | `application/json` | Protocol summary (name, description, website, docs) **plus the live market list** — each entry with jToken symbol, jToken address, and underlying token (or `"native TRX"`). Generated from `chains.ts`, so addresses stay in sync with the deployed contracts. |

Use the resource for a one-shot "what is JustLend / which markets exist / what are the addresses" lookup; use the tools for live balances, rates, and positions.

### Machine-Readable ABIs

For programmatic contract calls without re-fetching from Tronscan, the MCP server bundles all JustLend contract ABIs in TypeScript form:

- **Source**: [`src/core/abis.ts`](https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend/blob/main/src/core/abis.ts) (jToken, Comptroller, Oracle, TRC20)
- **Chain configs (Mainnet / Nile testnet)**: [`src/core/chains.ts`](https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend/blob/main/src/core/chains.ts)

## Error contract

Every tool returns errors as structured JSON with `isError: true`, so an agent can branch without parsing prose:

```json
{ "error": "<sanitized message>", "errorCode": "<code>", "retryable": true, "hint": "<how to fix>" }
```

`errorCode`, `retryable`, and `hint` are present when the error is recognized; unrecognized errors return just `error`. Recognized codes:

| errorCode | retryable | Meaning / agent action |
|-----------|:---------:|------------------------|
| `transient` | ✅ true | Network/RPC timeout, `SERVER_BUSY`, 429/5xx — retry read-only calls after a short backoff; **never** blindly re-broadcast a write (re-query state first). |
| `insufficient_allowance` | ❌ false | Approve the spender first (`approve_underlying` / `approve_for_votes` / `approve_moolah_*`), then retry. |
| `insufficient_balance` | ❌ false | Lower the amount or fund the wallet; verify with `get_trx_balance` / `get_token_balance`. |
| `wallet_not_configured` | ❌ false | Configure a wallet (`import_wallet` / `connect_browser_wallet`), then `set_active_wallet`. |
| `execution_reverted` | ❌ false | Contract precondition failed (allowance / health / paused market) — simulate before broadcasting. |
| `market_not_found` | ❌ false | Verify the market symbol/address against `get_supported_markets`. |
| `invalid_address` | ❌ false | Use a Base58 TRON address (`T…`, 34 chars). |

Only `transient` is safe to auto-retry; every other code requires a corrective action first.

## Security Considerations

- **Browser wallet (recommended)**: Private keys never leave TronLink — the `tronlink-signer` SDK sends unsigned transactions to the browser and receives signed results
- **Encrypted agent-wallet**: Private keys are encrypted at rest in `~/.agent-wallet/` with file permissions `0600`/`0700` — never stored in environment variables or config files
- **No key in parameters**: All signing functions use the agent-wallet or browser wallet internally; private keys are never passed as function parameters or exposed via MCP tools
- **Import via CLI**: Use `npx agent-wallet import` from a terminal — private key import is not exposed as an MCP tool to avoid key exposure in AI conversation logs
- **Explicit approvals**: TRC20/JST approval tools require an exact amount, while `max` remains available only when the user explicitly opts in
- **Pre-flight checks**: Supply/repay validate allowance first, lending tools report energy/bandwidth sufficiency warnings, and reverted simulations are not broadcast
- **Typed broadcasts**: Transaction broadcasts are parsed with typed responses so failed or rejected broadcasts surface as errors instead of ambiguous transaction IDs
- **Write operations** are clearly marked with `destructiveHint: true` in MCP annotations
- **Health factor checks** in prompts prevent dangerous borrowing
- Always **test on Nile testnet** before mainnet operations
- Be cautious with **unlimited approvals** (`approve_underlying` with `max`)

→ AI calls `get_energy_rent_info` to verify active rental → calls `return_energy_rental` → confirms refund

**"Stake 1000 TRX to earn sTRX rewards"**
→ AI uses `stake_trx` prompt: checks balance → checks exchange rate & APY → stakes TRX → verifies sTRX received
