Staked TRX is a feature launched by JustLend DAO that enables one-click TRX staking in accordance with Stake 2.0 rules. Once you have staked your TRX, JustLend DAO will take care of the cumbersome procedures, such as Super Representative (SR) voting and reward claiming, and rent out the Energy obtained from TRX staking automatically to generate more yields for you.

The SRs receiving your TRON Power obtained from staking TRX will be decided via voting by sTRX Governance. The whole process will be open, transparent, and fully decentralized.

### **Architecture of the sTRX system**

* **TRX Holders:** deposit TRX into the TRC484 contract to receive sTRX at the current exchange rate.

* **sTRX Holders:**
    * Convert sTRX back to TRX at the exchange rate to exit the system;
    * Participate in the governance of TRC484, including Super Representative (SR) voting, resource market interest rate adjustments, and other decisions;
    * Use sTRX as a standard TRC20 token to engage with various applications within the TRON ecosystem.

* **Resource Consumers:**
    * Rent resources within TRC484 by staking TRX (TRX deposited in sTRX system cannot be used for this purpose);
    * Return rented resources, pay the rental fees, and reclaim the remaining staked TRX in TRC484.

* **Liquidators:** liquidate overdue resource rental transactions and earn liquidation rewards.

### **Staked TRX Yield**
The sources of yields form staking TRX is mainly composed of two parts:

* **Voting rewards:** the rewards for voting TRON Power obtained from TRX staking to SRs;
* **Energy rental rewards:** the revenue from Energy Rental on JustLend DAO, distributed to stakers according to the amount and percentage of TRX they have staked.

The staking APY fluctuates with the changes in voting rewards and the Energy rental market. You can check the latest APY anytime in [Staked TRX](https://app.justlend.org/strx?lang=en-US) page.
